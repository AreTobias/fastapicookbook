# Introduction

This repo is my journey through the book called "Fastapi cookbook" which is an introduction to all the nuances and functionality that FastAPI can provide.

This book is intended to provide you with insight on how to build robust, secure and scalable modern web APIs. 

FastAPI is an API framework in Python, but it's functionality and best practices can be transferred to any modern framework in any other language.
